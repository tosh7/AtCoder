## Languages
I prefer using C++, which is one of the fastest programming languages. This [reference](https://www.cplusplus.com/) would help you to use C++.

## How to start
Copy base directory and rename for the event. Encorege you to name as "yyyymmdd_$level_$number".
All inputs should put in `input.txt`.

## How to compile
To make compile easier, I set an alias.

```
alias ac='g++ Main.cpp;./a.out < input.txt'
```
All you have to do is just do 'ac' command.
